This solution is incorrect because in removeDuplicates method, when find out employee duplicate, 
tracker HashMap will be set visited in current employee = true. So the sequence of incorrect results will be: 

- This employee value in tracker HashMap will change visited value from false to true
- This employee key in tracker will change visited value from false to true also.
- Now in tracker HashMap will has Employee key which has visited = true
- When traverse to next Employee which not visited but have same name and salary, it will be put to tracker and 
noDupsList because its visited = false, then the equals method in containsKey method return false. In this scenario, 
if an employee appears x times in Input Employee list, noDupsList will contain (x+1)/2 duplicates employee.
- The listsAreEqual method does not work correctly as expected also, even in case size of answer equals to size of dupsRemoved. 
Because answer list has at least 1 employee has visited = true, but dupsRemoved list has no employee has visited = true. 
So that equals method when execute contains method will return false. So, the final result will be false.
