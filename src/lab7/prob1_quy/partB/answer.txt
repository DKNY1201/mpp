The function public boolean equals(Employee e) is not an Overridding of equals(Object o) of Object class.
When we use contain() method in class List, it loop though the elements in List and compare using equals(Object o)
method from Object class (because JVM doesnâ€™t find any overridding version) and this equals() method check 2 things:
- obj1 == obj2
- references of these two reference variable point to the same object
so the result is false.
